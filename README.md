# 📸 ImageGallery

This is a **mini image gallery app** built with **Angular** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. Although it’s a small project, I used it as an opportunity to sharpen my Angular skills — focusing on **mobile-first design** and **reusable components**. Yes, Angular might feel like overkill here, but hey, it’s all about learning and pushing boundaries! 💪
